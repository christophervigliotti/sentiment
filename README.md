# Requirement

Make a basic Ruby app that measures the sentiment of tweets. There are two .txt files in the data directory that contain positive and negative words. There is a .txt file in the spec/fixtures that contains a few hundred tweets.  The idea is that you read the files, take in the data and return the @analysis

The goal is to get the specs to pass.  Using RSpec, type `rspec spec` to run the tests. Some are marked as skip with the `x` in front of the `it`.
